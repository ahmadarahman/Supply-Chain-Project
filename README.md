[Systematic Literature Review of Supply Chain Relationship Approaches amongst Business-to-Business Partners](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/21/11935) is referenced to get a list of categorizations to identify roles in the supply chain.

<details>

<summary>The categorizations are as follows </summary>

<ol>
    <li>Collaboration - collaborative relationships mostly affect the fulfilment and consumption phases of the procurement cycle</li>
    <li>Cooperative - A cooperative relationship evolves through repeated transactions into a long-term partnership based on trust and loyalty </li>
    <li>Coordination - Defines supply chain relationships as the coordination of activities into a seamless process </li>
    <li>Adversarial - Adversarial relationships include attributes such as short-term contracts, tough negotiation and multiple sourcing. These would affect </li>
    <li>Transactional - A transactional relationship is characterised by a discrete dyadic exchange between sellers and buyers with few personal relationships. Focused on customer side needs like timeliness </li>
    <li>Competition - <</li>
    <li>Coopetitive -  In coopetitive relationships, firms engage in cooperative and competitive activities at the same time</li>
</ol>
</details>
Relationships 1-3 are based on trust. 4-6 are power based relationships (one firm exerts more influence upon the other). These are often the most advantagueous.
